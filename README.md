# My oficial Portfolio

This is my portfolio website, the design was completely based on [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com) website so got to her [repository](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) and give her a star.

But I made everything on this website besides the design. If you want to use this for your portfolio just give credit to me and brittany.
