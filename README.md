This is my portfolio website, it was completely based on [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com) website so got to her repository and give her a star.

## Installation
To start, you have two options:
  1. Make a fork from this repository. _`not recommended`_
  2. Press the **`Use this template`** button and follow the GitHub instructions. _`recommended`_


Then, on the project `folder/directory`, run the command to install all the dependencies.
```bash
yarn install
```

_You can use `npm` if you prefer_

# Run Locally
Because of Vite, when all the dependencies are installed, it's super simple to start a local server.

### Development.
This should make a local server on the port 3000.
```bash
yarn dev
```
With the code running, go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Production.
This command will generate a production version of your code.
```bash
yarn build
```

And to check production locally. _(need to run build first)_
```bash
yarn preview
```
